# Portal 2 Compile Tools

This repository contains custom versions of the Source Engine compile tools to be used with Portal 2. These are based on the ported Source 2013 compiler code from [Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_public_src), and built against [Emulsion SDK](https://github.com/theKlaxon/emulsion-sdk/) in order to be compatible with Portal 2.

Currently, building VBSP, VVIS, and VRAD is supported. HLMV code [from the 2006 SDK](https://github.com/Source-SDK-Archives/source-sdk-2006-ep1/tree/master/utils/hlmv) is included, but probably won't compile yet.
